Thanks for your interest in my work! I am a PhD student in the Mechanical and Aersopace Engineering department at UC San Diego doing research in control theory, a branch of applied math used throughout engineering.
My goal is to leverage control theory to advance medicine, biology, and technology.

I am grateful to be advised by [Dr. Sylvia Herbert](https://sylviaherbert.com) and [Dr. Boris Kramer](https://kramer.ucsd.edu).
I am also grateful to the various programs that have supported my work: the NIH Intramural Research Training Award, the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, the NIH-UCSD Interfaces Training Grant, and the ARCS Scholarship.

## Prior education and training
I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University with a focus in Computational Biology.
Afterwards, I did research in computational biology at the NIH for two years, and I subsequently obtained my Master's degree in Biological Engineering from MIT.
While at MIT, I did research at the intersection of biology and control theory, inspiring my decision to do a PhD in the latter.

## Why do you do your research?
We live in a world increasingly reliant on "black-box" algorithms.
They are already being used in self-driving cars and robotics, and they are progressively becoming more central to bioscience and clinical decision-making.
While these technologies can be highly performant, they often fail in unpredictable and perplexing ways (ever seen a chat-bot hallucinate?).

I want to help make our algorithms safer.
Doing so involves a lot of math and computer science, but also a lot of domain knowledge, so I have to (really get to) speak many languages to do my work.
I also love my research because on a day-to-day level, it involves solving interesting puzzles and close collaboration with many amazing colleagues.

Thanks for your interest in my work! I am a PhD student in the Mechanical and Aersopace Engineering Program at UC San Diego doing research in control theory, a branch of applied math used across engineering disciplines.
My goal is to use control theory to advance medicine, biology, and technology.

## Education and training
I recieved my Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University, my Master's in Biological Engineering from MIT, and did research in computational biology at the NIH for two years between these degrees.
While at MIT, I did research at the intersection of computational biology and control theory, inspiring my decision to do a PhD in the latter.

I am grateful to be advised by Dr. Sylvia Herbert (https://sylviaherbert.com) and Dr. Boris Kramer (https://kramer.ucsd.edu).
I am also grateful to the various programs that have supported my work: the NIH Intramural Research Training Award, the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, the NIH-UCSD Interfaces Training Grant, and the ARCS Scholarship.

## Why do you do your research?
We live in a world increasingly reliant on algorithms, often ones which are "black-box" in nature.
These technologies are already being used in self-driving cars and robotics, and will be increasingly used in bioscience and clinical decision-making.
While they can be highly performant, these algorithms often fail in unpredictable and perplexing ways (ever seen a chat-bot hallucinate?).

I want to help make our algorithms safer.
Doing so involves a lot of math and computer science, but also a lot of domain knowledge, so I have to (really get to) speak many languages to do my work.

At a day-to-day level, I also love my research because it involves solving interesting mathematical puzzles and close collaboration with many amazing colleagues.

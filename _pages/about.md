Thanks for your interest in my work! I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical and Aersopace Engineering at UC San Diego.
I do research in [control theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBC1nEq0_nk), a branch of applied math that is used across engineering disciplines and intersects with machine learning in the [reinforcement learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MNVhXEX9to&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNQe1JXNvaFvURxGY4gE9k74) paradigm.
I work on (1) making algorithms for control and reinforcement learning safer in general and (2) specifically applying these algorithms in biology and medicine.

I am grateful to be advised by [Dr. Sylvia Herbert](https://sylviaherbert.com) and [Dr. Boris Kramer](https://kramer.ucsd.edu).
I am also grateful to the various programs that have supported my work: the [NIH Intramural Research Training Award](https://www.training.nih.gov/research-training/pb/pb/#about-this-program), the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program), the [NIH-UCSD Interfaces Training Grant](https://interfaces.ucsd.edu), and the [ARCS Foundation Scholarship](https://www.arcsfoundation.org/national-homepage).

## Prior education and training
I completed my undergraduate degree in biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University, with a focus in computational biology and a minor in computational medicine.
Afterwards, I did research in computational biology at the National Institutes of Health for two years, and I subsequently obtained my master's degree in biological engineering from MIT.
While at MIT, I did research at the intersection of biology and control theory, leading to my decision to do a Ph.D. in the latter.

## Why this research?
We live in a world increasingly reliant on "black-box" algorithms.
They are already being used in self-driving cars and robotics, and they are progressively becoming more central to bioscience and clinical decision-making.
While these technologies can be highly performant, they often fail in unpredictable and perplexing ways (ever seen a chat-bot hallucinate?).

**I want to help make our algorithms safer.**
Doing so involves a lot of math and computer science, but also a lot of domain knowledge, so I have to (really get to) speak many languages to do my work.
I also love my research because on a day-to-day level, it involves solving interesting puzzles and close collaboration with many amazing colleagues.
